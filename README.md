# esp32wrover-ardupilot-pcb
a custom pcb with integrated components, i will not be working on this anymore so feel free to change it up a bit, fix it :D and use it

things that would make the pcb better is 
  changing barometer and imu from i2c to spi
  rethinking the voltage regulators that need to be able to support 5s batteries
